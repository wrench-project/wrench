/**
 ** This simulator simulates the execution of a one-action job, where the
 ** action is a powerful custom action
 **
 ** The compute platform comprises 6 hosts hosts, UserHost, StorageHost1, StorageHost2, ComputeHost1,
 ** ComputeHost2, CloudHeadHost, and CloudComputeHost.
 ** On UserHost runs a controller (defined in class MultiActionMultiJobController). On StorageHost1 and
 ** StorageHost2 run two storage services.  On ComputeHost1 runs a bare-metal
 ** compute service, that has access to the 10 cores of that host on on ComputeHost2.  On CloudHeadHost runs
 ** a cloud service, that has access to the 10 cores of host CloudComputeHost. This cloud-service
 ** has a scratch space (i.e., a local storage service "mounted" at /scratch/)
 **
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator with no logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-communicating-actions ./dragonfly_cluster.xml
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator with only WMS logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-communicating-actions ./dragonfly_cluster.xml --log=custom_controller.threshold=info
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator with full logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-communicating-actions ./dragonfly_cluster.xml --wrench-full-log
