/**
 ** This simulator simulates the execution of two batch compute services, each used by their own controller.
 ** The controllers "talk to each other" to delegate some jobs to the other controller.  There is a third
 ** controller that submits job requests to either of the previous two controllers.
 **
 ** The compute platform comprises seven hosts:
 **   - UserHost: runs the execution controller that creates job requests and sends them to one of the batch controllers
 **   - Batch1HeadNode, Batch1ComputeNode1,and Batch1ComputeNode2: the first batch system, which runs on Batch1HeadNode, along with a controller
 **   - Batch2HeadNode, Batch2ComputeNode1,and Batch2ComputeNode2: the second batch system, which runs on Batch2HeadNode, along with a controller
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator for 10 jobs, with no logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-batch-bag-of-actions 10 ./two_batch_services.xml
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator for 10 jobs, with only execution controller logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-batch-bag-of-actions 10 ./two_batch_services.xml --log=custom_controller.threshold=info
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator for 10 jobs, with full logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-batch-bag-of-actions 6 ./two_batch_services.xml --wrench-full-log
