/**
 ** This simulator simulates the execution of a 2-task workflow:
 **
 **   File #0 -> Task #0 -> File #1 -> Task #1 -> File #2
 **
 ** The compute platform comprises four hosts, WMSHost,  BatchHeadNode, BatchNode1, and
 **  BatchNode2. On WMSHost runs a simple storage
 ** service and a WMS (defined in class PilotJobWMS). On BatchHeadNode runs a batch
 ** service, that has access to two hosts: BatchNode1 and BatchNode2. Once the simulation is done,
 ** the completion time of each workflow task is printed.
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator with no logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-batch-pilot-job ./four_hosts_scratch.xml
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator with only WMS logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-batch-pilot-job ./four_hosts_scratch.xml --log=custom_wms.threshold=info
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator with full logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-batch-pilot-job ./four_hosts_scratch.xml --wrench-full-log
