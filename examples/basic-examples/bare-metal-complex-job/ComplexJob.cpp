/**
 ** This simulator simulates the execution of a one-task workflow, where the task  is:
 **
 **   {InFile #0, InFile #1} -> Task -> {OutFile #0, OutFile #1}
 **
 ** The compute platform comprises four hosts, WMSHost, StorageHost1, StorageHost2, and ComputeHost.
 ** On WMSHost runs a WMS (defined in class ComplexJobWMS). On ComputeHost runs a bare metal
 ** compute service, that has access to the 10 cores of that host. On StorageHost1 and
 ** StorageHost2 run two storage services.  Once the simulation is done,
 ** the completion time of each workflow task is printed.
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator with no logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-bare-metal-complex-job ./four_hosts.xml
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator with only WMS logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-bare-metal-complex-job ./four_hosts.xml --log=custom_wms.threshold=info
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator for a 5-task workflow with full logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-bare-metal-complex-job ./four_hosts.xml --wrench-full-log
