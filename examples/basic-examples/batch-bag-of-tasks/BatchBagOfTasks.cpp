/**
 ** This simulator simulates the execution of a bag-of-tasks workflow, that is, of a workflow
 ** in which each task has its own input file and its own output file, and tasks can be
 ** executed completely independently
 **
 **   InputFile #0 -> Task #0 -> OutputFile #1
 **   ...
 **   InputFile #n -> Task #n -> OutputFile #n
 **
 ** The compute platform comprises four hosts, WMSHost,  BatchHeadNode, BatchNode1, and
 **  BatchNode2. On WMSHost runs a simple storage
 ** service and a WMS (defined in class TwoTasksAtATimeBatchWMS). On BatchHeadNode runs a batch
 ** service, that has access to two hosts: BatchNode1 and BatchNode2. Once the simulation is done,
 ** the completion time of each workflow task is printed.
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator for a 10-task workflow, with no logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-batch-bag-of-tasks 10 ./four_hosts.xml
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator for a 10-task workflow, with only WMS logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-batch-bag-of-tasks 10 ./four_hosts.xml --log=custom_wms.threshold=info
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator for a 6-task workflow with full logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-batch-bag-of-tasks 6 ./four_hosts.xml --wrench-full-log
