 ** A Workflow Management System (WMS) implementation that operates as follows:
 **  - While the workflow is not done, repeat:
 **    - Pick up to two ready tasks
 **    - Submit both of them as part of a single job to the first available BareMetalComputeService so tbat:
 **       - The most expensive task uses 6 cores
 **       - The least expensive task uses 4 cores
 **       - Each task reads the input file from the StorageService
 **       - Each task reads the output file from the StorageService
