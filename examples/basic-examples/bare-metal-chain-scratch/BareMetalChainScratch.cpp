/**
 ** This simulator simulates the execution of a chain workflow, that is, of a workflow
 ** in which each task has at most a single parent and at most a single child:
 **
 **   File #0 -> Task #0 -> File #1 -> Task #1 -> File #2 -> .... -> Task #n-1 -> File #n
 **
 ** The compute platform comprises two hosts, WMSHost and ComputeHost. On WMSHost runs a simple storage
 ** service and a WMS (defined in class OneTaskAtATimeWMS). On ComputeHost runs a bare metal
 ** compute service, that has access to the 10 cores of that host. Once the simulation is done,
 ** the completion time of each workflow task is printed.
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator for a 10-task workflow, with no logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-bare-metal-chain 10 ./two_hosts.xml
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator for a 10-task workflow, with only WMS logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-bare-metal-chain 10 ./two_hosts.xml --log=custom_wms.threshold=info
 **
 ** Example invocation of the simulator for a 5-task workflow with full logging:
 **    ./wrench-example-bare-metal-chain 5 ./two_hosts.xml --wrench-full-log
