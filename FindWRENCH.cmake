# USERS OF PROGRAMS USING WRENCH
# -------------------------------
#
# If cmake does not find this file, add its path to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:
#    CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/path/to/FindWRENCH.cmake:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH"  cmake .
#
# If this file does not find WRENCH, define WRENCH_PATH:
#    WRENCH_PATH=/path/to/wrench cmake .

#
# DEVELOPERS OF PROGRAMS USING WRENCH
# ------------------------------------
#
#  1. Include this file in your own CMakeLists.txt (before defining any target)
#     by copying it in your development tree. 
#
#  2. Afterward, if you have CMake >= 2.8.12, this will define a
#     target called 'WRENCH::WRENCH'. Use it as:
#       target_link_libraries(your-simulator WRENCH::WRENCH)
#
#    With older CMake (< 2.8.12), it simply defines several variables:
#       WRENCH_INCLUDE_DIR - the WRENCH include directories
#       WRENCH_LIBRARY - link your simulator against it to use WRENCH
#    Use as:
#      include_directories("${WRENCH_INCLUDE_DIR}" SYSTEM)
#      target_link_libraries(your-simulator ${WRENCH_LIBRARY})
#
#  Since WRENCH header files require C++17, so we set CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD to 17.
#    Change this variable in your own file if you need a later standard.
