# Wrench Dashboard 

Welcome to the Wrench Dashboard! This is where you can fulfill all of your data visualisation needs.

## Instructions to run

The dashboard works by parsing a JSON dump file from a simulation and creating graphs in local HTML file that you can then view in your browser.

All you need to do is open `index.html` in this directory and upload your file there. You can also run `../wrench-init/wrench-dashboard.sh` which will automatically open `index.html` in your default browser.
