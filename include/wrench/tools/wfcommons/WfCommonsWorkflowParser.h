         * @brief Create an abstract workflow based on a JSON file in the WfFormat (version 1.4) from WfCommons. This method
         *        makes executive decisions when information in the JSON file is incomplete and/or contradictory. Pass true
         *        as the last argument to see all warnings on stderr.
         *
         *
         * @param filename: the path to the JSON file
         * @param reference_flop_rate: a reference compute speed (in flops/sec), assuming a task's computation is purely flops.
         *                             This is needed because JSON files specify task execution times in seconds,
         *                             but the WRENCH simulation needs some notion of "amount of computation" to
         *                             apply reasonable scaling. (Because the XML platform description specifies host
         *                             compute speeds in flops/sec). The times in the JSON file are thus assumed to be
         *                             obtained on an machine with flop rate reference_flop_rate. NOTE: This is only used
         *                             if the JSON file does not provide information regarding the machine on which a task
         *                             was executed. In this case, the machine speed information is used.
         * @param redundant_dependencies: Workflows provided by WfCommons
         *                             sometimes include control/data dependencies between tasks that are already induced by
         *                             other control/data dependencies (i.e., they correspond to transitive
         *                             closures or existing edges in the workflow graphs). Passing redundant_dependencies=true
         *                             force these "redundant" dependencies to be added as edges in the workflow. Passing
         *                             redundant_dependencies=false will ignore these "redundant" dependencies. Most users
         *                             would likely pass "false".
         * @param ignore_cycle_creating_dependencies: if true, simply ignore dependencies that would make the workflow graph
         *                             acyclic. If false, throw an exception if the workflow graph would be made acyclic by
         *                             adding a dependency.
         * @param min_cores_per_task: If the JSON file does not specify a number of cores for a task, the minimum number of
         *                            cores on which the task can run is set to this value. (default is 1)
         * @param max_cores_per_task: If the JSON file does not specify a number of cores for a task, the maximum number of
         *                            cores on which the task can run is set to this value. (default is 1)
         * @param enforce_num_cores: Use the min_cores_per_task and max_cores_per_task values even if the JSON file specifies
         *                           a number of cores for a task. (default is false)
         * @param ignore_avg_cpu: In WfCommons tasks can include a avgCPU field. If this field is provided, it is used to determine
         *                        the fraction of the task's execution time that corresponds to CPU usage, which is then used
         *                        to compute the task's work in flop. If set to true, then the task's execution time reported in the
         *                        JSON will be assumed to be 100% CPU work. (default is false)
         * @param show_warnings: Show all warnings. (default is false)
         * @return a workflow
