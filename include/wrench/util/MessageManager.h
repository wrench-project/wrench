     * @brief A helper class that manages messages (in terms of memory_manager_service deallocation to avoid leaks when
     *        a message was sent but never received). That is, if messages are in flight when the receiver daemon fails,
     *        than, because the receiver is the one freeing memory, we have memory leaks.
     *        This takes extra time however, and many simulations never simulate failures anyway, so it's use is only optional
     *        at compile time. Perhaps woudl be a good idea to make its usage optional at runtime?
