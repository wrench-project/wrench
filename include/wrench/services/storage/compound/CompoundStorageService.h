     * @brief An abstract storage service which holds a collection of concrete storage services (eg. 
     *        SimpleStorageServices). It does not provide direct access to any storage resource.
     *        It is meant to be used as a way to postpone the selection of a storage service for a file 
     *        action (read, write, copy, etc) until a later time in the simulation, rather than during
     *        job definition. A typical use for the CompoundStorageService is to select a definitive
     *        SimpleStorageService for each action of a job during its scheduling in a BatchScheduler class.
     *        This service is able to receive and handle the same messages as any standard storage service 
     *        (File Read/Write/Delete/Copy/Lookup requests), but will always answer that it is unable to 
     *        process any of these requests, which should be addressed directly to the correct underlying 
     *        storage service. (A possible future patch could give it the ability to automatically forward 
     *        said request to one of the underlying storage services).
