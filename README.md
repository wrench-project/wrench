**_Workflow Management System Simulation Workbench_**

WRENCH is an _open-source library_ for developing workflow simulators. WRENCH exposes several high-level simulation 
abstractions to provide the **building blocks** for developing custom simulators.

More information and Documentation: [WRENCH Project Website](http://wrench-project.org)

**WRENCH Research Paper:**
- H. Casanova, S. Pandey, J. Oeth, R. Tanaka, F. Suter, and R. Ferreira da Silva, “[WRENCH: A Framework for Simulating Workflow Management Systems](http://rafaelsilva.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/casanova-works-2018.pdf),” in 13th Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS’18), 2018, p. 74–85. 

## Prerequisites

WRENCH is fully developed in C++. The code follows the C++11 standard, and thus older 
compilers tend to fail the compilation process. Therefore, we strongly recommend
users to satisfy the following requirements:

- **CMake** - version 3.5 or higher
  
And, one of the following:
- **g++** - version 5.0 or higher
- **clang** - version 3.6 or higher

## Dependencies

### Required Dependencies 

- [SimGrid](https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid/-/releases) - version 3.25
- [Lemon C++ library](http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/) - version 1.3.1 or higher 
- [PugiXML](http://pugixml.org/) - version 1.8 or higher 
- [JSON for Modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) - version 3.7.0 or higher 

### Optional Dependencies
- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) - version 1.8 or higher (only required for running test cases)
- [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) - version 1.8 or higher (only required for generating documentation)
- [Batsched](https://gitlab.inria.fr/batsim/batsched) - only needed for batch-scheduled resource simulation

## Building From Source

If all dependencies are installed, compiling and installing WRENCH is as simple as running:

```bash
cmake .
make
sudo make install
```

For enabling the use of Batsched:
```bash
cmake -DENABLE_BATSCHED=on .
make
sudo make install
```

To use a non-standard SimGrid installation path:
```bash
cmake -DSIMGRID_INSTALL_PATH=/my/simgrid/path/ .
make
sudo make install 
```



## Get in Touch

The main channel to reach the WRENCH team is via the support email: 
[support@wrench-project.org](mailto:support@wrench-project.org).

**Bug Report / Feature Request:** our preferred channel to report a bug or request a feature is via  
WRENCH's [Github Issues Track](https://github.com/wrench-project/wrench/issues).

## Citing WRENCH

When citing WRENCH, please use the following paper. You should also actually read that paper, as 
it provides a recent and general overview on the framework.

```latex
@inproceedings{wrench,
  title = {WRENCH: A Framework for Simulating Workflow Management Systems},
  author = {Casanova, Henri and Pandey, Suraj and Oeth, James and Tanaka, Ryan and Suter, Frederic and Ferreira da Silva, Rafael},
  booktitle = {13th Workshop on Workflows in Support of Large-Scale Science (WORKS'18)},
  year = {2018},
  pages = {74--85},
  doi = {10.1109/WORKS.2018.00013}
