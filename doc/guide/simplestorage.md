# Overview #            {#guide-simplestorage-overview}

A Simple storage service is the simplest possible abstraction for a 
service that can store and provide workflow files. It has a certain storage
capacity, and provides write, read, and delete operations on files. Writes
and Reads can be done synchronously or asynchronously. In addition, higher-level
semantics such as copying a file directly from a storage service to another
are provided. 

# Creating a Simple storage service #        {#guide-simplestorage-creating}

In WRENCH, a Simple storage service represents a storage service
(`wrench::StorageService`), which is defined by the `wrench::SimpleStorage`
class. An instantiation of a Simple storage service requires the following
parameters:

- The name of a host on which to start the service (this is the entry point to the service);
- A capacity in bytes;
- Maps (`std::map`) of configurable properties (`wrench::BatchComputeServiceProperty`) and configurable message
  payloads (`wrench::BatchComputeServiceMessagePayload`).
  
The example below shows how to create an instance of a Simple storage service
that runs on host "Gateway", has access to 64TiB of storage. 
Furthermore, the number of maximum concurrent data connections supported by
the service is configured to be 8:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
auto storage_service = simulation->add(
          new wrench::SimpleStorageService("Gateway", 
                                  pow(2,46),
                                       {{wrench::SimpleStorageProperty::MAX_NUM_CONCURRENT_DATA_CONNECTIONS, "8"}}
                                      );
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Using a simple storage service #        {#guide-simplestorage-using}

One can interact directly with a simple storage service to check whether
the service hosts a particular file or to delete a file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
wrench::WorkflowFile *some_file;

[...]

if (storage_service->lookupFile(some_file)) {
  std::cerr << "File is there! Let's delete it...\n";
  storage_service->deleteFile(some_file);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While there are few other direct interactions are possible 
(see the documentation of the `wrench::StorageService` and `wrench::SimpleStorageService` classes), many interactions are via a data movement manager (an instance of the `wrench::DataMovementManager` class).  This is a helper process that makes it possible interact asynchronously and transparently with storage services.
For instance, here is an example of a synchronous file copy:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
wrench::WorkflowFile *some_file;
wrench::StorageService *src, *dst;

[...]

// Create a job manager
auto job_manager = this->createJobManager();

job_manager->doSynchronousFileCopy(some_file, src, dst);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above call blocks until the file copy has completed. An asynchronous file copy would work as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
wrench::WorkflowFile *some_file;
wrench::StorageService *src, *dst;

[...]

// Create a job manager
auto job_manager = this->createJobManager();

job_manager->initiateAsynchronousFileCopy(some_file, src, dst);

[...]

// Wait for a workflow execution event
auto event = this->getWorkflow()->waitForNextExecutionEvent();

if (event->type == wrench::WorkflowExecutionEvent::FILE_COPY_COMPLETION) {
  std::cerr << "Success!\n";
} else if (event->type == wrench::WorkflowExecutionEvent::FILE_COPY_COMPLETION) {
  std::cerr << "Failure!\n";
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the documentation of the `wrench::DataMovementManager` class for all available API methods.
