Interacting with a batch compute service
========================================

A job, either :cpp:class:`wrench::StandardJob` or :cpp:class:`wrench::PilotJob`, can be
submitted to a :cpp:class:`wrench::BatchComputeService` by a call to the
:cpp:class:`wrench::JobManager::submitJob()` method. However, it is **required**
to pass to it a service-specific argument. This argument is a
``std::map<std::string, std::string>`` of key-value pairs, and must have
the following three elements:

-  key: ``-t``; value: a requested runtime in seconds that, if exceeded,
   causes forceful job termination (e.g., “60”);
-  key: ``-N``; value: a requested number of compute nodes (e.g., “2”);
   and
-  key: ``-c``; value: a requested number of cores per compute nodes
   (e.g., “4”).

You may note that the above corresponds to the arguments that must be
provided to the :ref:`Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>` batch scheduler.

Here is an example job submission to the batch service:

.. code:: cpp

   std::shared_ptr<wrench::BatchComputeService> some_batch_service;

   // Create a job manager
   auto job_manager = this->createJobManager();

   // Create a job
   auto job = job_manager->createStandardJob(tasks);

   // Create service-specific arguments
   std::map<std::string, std::string> service_specific_args;

   //   The job will run no longer than 1 hour
   service_specific_args["-t"] = "3600";

   //   The job will run on 2 compute nodes
   service_specific_args["-N"] = "2";

   //   The job will use 4 cores on each compute nodes
   service_specific_args["-c"] = "4";

   // Submit the job
   job_manager->submitJob(job, some_batch_service, service_specific_args);

   //  Wait for and process the next event
   this->waitForAndProcessNextEvent();

If the service-specific arguments are invalid (e.g., number of nodes too
large), :cpp:class:`wrench::JobManager::submitJob()` method throws a
:cpp:class:`wrench::ExecutionException`.

See the execution controller implementation in
``examples/workflow_api/basic-examples/batch-bag-of-tasks/TwoTasksAtATimeBatchWMS.cpp``
for a more complete example.

A batch compute service also supports pilot jobs. Once started, a pilot
job exposes a temporary (only running until its containing pilot job
expires) bare-metal compute service. Here is a simple code excerpt:

.. code:: cpp

   // create a pilot job
   auto pilot_job = job_manager->createPilotJob();

   // submit it to the batch compute service, asking for 2 10-core nodes for 1200 seconds
   std::map<std::string, std::string> service_specific_arguments = 
               {{"-N","2"},{"-c","10"},{"-t","1200"}};
   job_manager->submitJob(pilot_job, some_batch_service, service_specific_arguments);

   // Waiting for the next event (which will be a pilot job start event)
   this->waitForAndProcessNextEvent();

   // Get a reference to the bare-metal compute service running on the pilot job
   auto cs = pilot_job->getComputeService();

   // Start using the bare-metal compute service
   [...]

While the pilot job is running, :ref:`standard jobs can be submitted to its
bare-metal service <guide-102-baremetal>`.

See the execution controller implementation in
``examples/workflow_api/basic-examples/batch-pilot-job/PilotJobWMS.cpp``
for a more complete example.
