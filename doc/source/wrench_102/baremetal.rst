Interacting with a bare-metal compute service
=============================================

A :cpp:class:`wrench::StandardJob` can be submitted to a bare-metal compute
service via a job manager. For instance:

.. code:: cpp

   std::shared_ptr<wrench::BareMetalComputeService> some_bare_metal_service;

   // Create a job manager
   auto job_manager = this->createJobManager();

   // Create a standard job with 4 workflow tasks 
   auto job = job_manager->createStandardJob(
                    {this->getWorklow()->getTaskByID("task"),
                     this->getWorklow()->getTaskByID("task2"),
                     this->getWorklow()->getTaskByID("task3"),
                     this->getWorklow()->getTaskByID("task4")});

   // Submit the job to the bare-metal service
   job_manager->submitJob(job, some_bare_metal_service);

   //  Wait for and process the next event (should be a standard job completion or failure)
   this->waitForAndProcessNextEvent();

In the above, the bare-metal service will make all decisions for
deciding how to allocate compute resources (i.e., cores) to tasks. In
fact, several properties (see class
:cpp:class:`wrench::BareMetalComputeServiceProperty`) can be set to change the
algorithms used by the service to determine resource allocations.

In some cases, the execution controller may want to influence or enforce
resource allocations for the tasks in the jobs. For this purpose, the
:cpp:class:`wrench::JobManager::submitJob()` method takes an optional
**service-specific argument**. This argument is a
``std::map<std::string, std::string>`` of key-value pairs. The key is a
task ID, and the value is the service-specific argument for that task.

For each task, an optional argument can be provided as a string
formatted as "hostname:num_cores", "hostname", or "num_cores", where
"hostname" is the name of one of the service’s compute hosts and
"num_cores" is an integer (e.g., "host1:10", "host1", "10"):

-  If no value is provided for a task, or if the value is the empty
   string, then the bare-metal service will choose the host on which the
   task should be executed (typically the host with the lowest current
   load), and will execute the task with as many cores as possible on
   that host.

-  If a "hostname" value is provided for a task, then the bare-metal
   service will execute the task on that host, and will execute the task
   with as many cores as possible on that host.

-  If a "num_cores" value is provided for a task, then the bare-metal
   service will choose the host on which the task should be executed
   (typically the host with the lowest current load), and will execute
   the task with the specified number of cores.

-  If a "hostname:num_cores" value is provided for a task, then the
   bare-metal service will execute the task on that host with the
   specified number of cores.

In the above example, for instance, the job submission could be done as:

.. code:: cpp

   // Create a service-specific argument std::map<std::string, std::string>
   service_specific_args;

   // task will run on host Node1 with as many cores as possible
   service_specific_args["task"] = "Node1";

   // task2 will run on host Node2 with 16 cores
   service_specific_args["task2"] = "Node2:16";

   // task3 will run on any host with as many cores as possible
   service_specific_args["task3"] = ""; // could be omitted altogether

   // task4 will run on some host with 4 cores
   service_specific_args["task4"] = "4";

   // Submit the job job_manager->submitJob(job, some_bare_metal_service,
   service_specific_args);

If the service-specific arguments are invalid (e.g., invalid hostname,
unknown task, number of cores too large), the
:cpp:class:`wrench::JobManager::submitJob()` method throws a
:cpp:class:`wrench::ExecutionException`.

See the execution controller implementation in
``examples/basic-examples/bare-metal-bag-of-tasks/TwoTasksAtATimeWMS.cpp``
for a more complete example.
