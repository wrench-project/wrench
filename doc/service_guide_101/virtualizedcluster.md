# Overview #            {#guide-virtualizedcluster-overview}

A virtualized cluster service is an abstraction of a compute service that
corresponds to a platform of physical resources on which Virtual Machine
(VM) instances can be created. A  virtualized cluster  service is very
similar to a a [cloud service](@ref guide-101-cloud), the only difference
being that the former exposes the underlying physical resources, while the
latter does not. More specifically, it is possible to instantiate a VM on a
particular physical host, and to migrate a VM between two physical hosts.


# Creating a virtualized cluster compute service #        {#guide-virtualizedcluster-creating}

In WRENCH, a virtualized cluster service is defined by the
wrench::VirtualizedClusterComputeService class. An instantiation of a
virtualized cluster service requires the following parameters:

- The name of a host on which to start the service;
- A list (`std::vector`) of hostnames (all cores and all RAM of each host is available to the virtualized cluster service);
- A mount point (corresponding to a disk attached to the host) for the scratch space, i.e., storage local to the virtualized cluster service (used to store
  workflow files, as needed, during job executions); and
- Maps (`std::map`) of configurable properties (`wrench::VirtualizedClusterComputeServiceProperty`) and configurable message
  payloads (`wrench::VirtualizedClusterComputeServiceMessagePayload`).

The example below creates an instance of a virtualized cluster service 
that runs on host `vc_gateway`, provides access to 4 execution hosts, and has a scratch 
space on the disk mounted at path `/scratch` at host `vc_gateway`. Furthermore, the VM boot time  is
configured to be 10 second, and the message with which the service answers resource description requests is configured to be 1KiB:


~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
auto virtualized_cluster_cs = simulation.add(
          new wrench::VirtualizedClusterComputeService("vc_gateway", {"host1", "host2", "host3", "host4"}, 
                                                "/scratch/", {{wrench::VirtualClusterComputeServiceProperty::VM_BOOT_OVERHEAD_IN_SECONDS, "10"}}, {{wrench::VirtualClusterComputeServiceMessagePayload::RESOURCE_DESCRIPTION_ANSWER_MESSAGE_PAYLOAD, 1024}}));

See the documentation of `wrench::VirtualizedClusterComputeServiceProperty` and
`wrench::VirtualizedClusterComputeServiceMessagePayload` for all possible configuration
options.

Also see the simulators in the `examples/basic-examples/virtualized-cluster-*/` directories, which use virtualized cluster services.
