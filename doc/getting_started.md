[TOC]

The first step is to install the WRENCH library, following the instructions
 on the [installation page](@ref install).

# Running a First Example #         {#getting-started-example}

 Typing `make` in the top-level directory
will compile the examples, and `make install` will put the examples binaries in the `/usr/local/bin` 
folder (for MacOS and most Linux distributions). 


WRENCH provides a simple example in the `examples/simple-example` directory, which 
generates two executables: a cloud-based 
example `wrench-simple-example-cloud`, and a 
batch-system-based (e.g., SLURM) example `wrench-simple-example-batch`.
To run the examples, simply use 
one of the following commands:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
# Runs the cloud-based implementation
wrench-simple-example-cloud \
    <PATH-TO-WRENCH-FOLDER>/examples/simple-example/platform_files/cloud_hosts.xml \
    <PATH-TO-WRENCH-FOLDER>/examples/simple-example/workflow_files/genome.dax

# Runs the batch-based implementation
wrench-simple-example-batch \
    <PATH-TO-WRENCH-FOLDER>/examples/simple-example/platform_files/batch_hosts.xml \
    <PATH-TO-WRENCH-FOLDER>/examples/simple-example/workflow_files/genome.dax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## Understanding the Simple Example      {#getting-started-example-simple}

Both versions of the example (cloud of batch) require two command-line arguments: (1) a [SimGrid virtual platform 
description file](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.19/doc/platform.html); and
(2) a WRENCH workflow file.

  - **SimGrid simulated platform description file:** 
A [SimGrid](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr) simulation must be provided with the description 
of the platform on which an application execution is to be simulated. This is done via
a platform description file, in XML, that includes definitions of compute hosts, clusters of hosts, 
storage resources, network links, routes between hosts, etc.
A detailed description on how to create a platform description file can be found
[here](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.19/doc/platform.html).

  - **WRENCH workflow file:**
WRENCH provides native parsers for [DAX](http://workflowarchive.org) (DAG in XML) 
and [JSON](https://github.com/wrench-project/wrench/tree/master/doc/schemas) workflow description file formats. Refer to 
their respective Web sites for detailed documentation.

The source file for the cloud-based simulator is at `examples/simple-example/SimulatorCloud.cpp`
 and at `examples/simple-example/SimulatorBatch.cpp` for the batch-based example. These source files, which
 are heavily commented, and perform the following:

- The first step is to read and parse the workflow and the platform files, and to
  create a simulation object (`wrench::Simulation`).
- A storage service (`wrench::SimpleStorageService`) is created and deployed on a host.
- A cloud (`wrench::CloudService`) or a batch (`wrench::BatchService`) service is created and 
  deployed on a host. Both services are seen by the simulation as compute services
  (`wrench::ComputeService`) â€“ jobs can then be submitted to these services. 
- A Workflow Management System (`wrench::WMS`) is instantiated (in this case the `SimpleWMS`) with a reference to 
  a workflow object (`wrench::Workflow`) and a scheduler (`wrench::Scheduler`). The scheduler implements the
  decision-making algorithms inside the WMS. These algorithms are modularized (so that the same WMS implementation can be iniated
  with various decision-making algorithms in different simulations). The source codes for the schedulers,
  which is of interest to "Developers" (i.e., those users who use the WRENCH Developer API), is in 
  directory `examples/scheduler`. 
- A file registry (`wrench::FileRegistryService`), a.k.a. a file replica catalog, which keeps track of files stored in different storage services, is deployed on a host. 
- Workflow input files are staged on the storage service
- The simulation is launched, executes, and completes.
- Timestamps can be retrieved to analyze the simulated execution.


This simple example can be used as a blueprint for starting a large WRENCH-based
simulation project. The next section provides further details about this process.

# Preparing the Environment #         {#getting-started-prep}

@WRENCHNotInternalDoc
## Importing WRENCH ##                {#getting-started-prep-import}

For ease of use, all WRENCH abstractions are accessed via a single 
include statement:

@WRENCHUserDoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <wrench.h>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@endWRENCHDoc

@WRENCHDeveloperDoc 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <wrench-dev.h>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that `wrench-dev.h` is the only necessary include statement to use WRENCH. 
It includes all interfaces and services provided in `wrench.h` 
([user API](../user/getting-started.html)), as well as additional interfaces to develop 
your own algorithms and services.

## Creating Your CMakeLists.txt File ##                {#getting-started-prep-cmakelists}

Below is an example of a `CMakeLists.txt` file that can be used as a starting 
template for developing a WRENCH application compiled using cmake:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cmake}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2)
message(STATUS "Cmake version ${CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION}.${CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION}.${CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION}")

project(YOUR_PROJECT_NAME)

add_definitions("-Wall -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-private-field")

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

# include directories for dependencies and WRENCH libraries
include_directories(src/ /usr/local/include /usr/local/include/wrench)

# source files
set(SOURCE_FILES
        src/main.cpp
        )

# test files
set(TEST_FILES
        )

# wrench library and dependencies
find_library(WRENCH_LIBRARY NAMES wrench)
find_library(SIMGRID_LIBRARY NAMES simgrid)
find_library(PUGIXML_LIBRARY NAMES pugixml)
find_library(LEMON_LIBRARY NAMES emon)
find_library(GTEST_LIBRARY NAMES gtest)

# generating the executable
add_executable(my-executable ${SOURCE_FILES})
target_link_libraries(my-executable 
                        ${WRENCH_LIBRARY} 
                        ${SIMGRID_LIBRARY} 
                        ${PUGIXML_LIBRARY} 
                        ${LEMON_LIBRARY}
                     )

install(TARGETS my-executable DESTINATION bin)

# generating unit tests
add_executable(unit_tests EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL 
                 ${SOURCE_FILES} 
                 ${TEST_FILES}
              )
target_link_libraries(unit_tests 
                        ${GTEST_LIBRARY} wrench -lpthread -lm
                     )
