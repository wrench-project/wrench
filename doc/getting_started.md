[TOC]

The first step is to have WRENCH library installed. If it is not done yet, please 
follow the instructions to [install it](@ref install).

# Running a First Example #         {#getting-started-example}

The WRENCH distribution provides an example WMS implementation (`SimpleWMS`) available 
in the `examples` folder. Note that a simple installation via `make && make install`
compiles all examples.

WRENCH provides two implementations for the `SimpleWMS` example: a cloud-based 
implementation `wrench-simple-wms-cloud`, and an implementation to run workflows 
in a batch system (e.g., SLURM) `wrench-simple-wms-batch`.

By default, a successful WRENCH installation puts the examples binaries in the `/usr/local/bin` 
folder (for MacOS and most Linux distributions). To run the examples, simply use 
one of the following commands:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
# running the cloud-based implementation
wrench-simple-wms-cloud <PATH-TO-WRENCH-SRC-FOLDER>/examples/cloud_hosts.xml <PATH-TO-WRENCH-SRC-FOLDER>/examples/genome.dax

# running the batch-based implementation
wrench-simple-wms-batch <PATH-TO-WRENCH-SRC-FOLDER>/examples/two_hosts.xml <PATH-TO-WRENCH-SRC-FOLDER>/examples/genome.dax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Understanding the Simple-WMS Examples      {#getting-started-example-simplewms}

The `SimpleWMS` example requires two arguments: (1) a [SimGrid virtual platform 
description file](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.17/doc/platform.html); and
(2) a WRENCH workflow file.

**SimGrid virtual platform description file:** 
Any [SimGrid](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr) simulation must be provided with the description 
of the platform on which an application exeuction is to be simulates. This is done via
a platform desctription file that includes 
definitions of compute hosts, clusters of hosts, storage resources, network links, routes between hosts, etc.
A detailed description on how to create a platform description file can be found
[here](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/3.17/doc/platform.html).

**WRENCH workflow file:**
WRENCH provides native parsers for [DAX](http://workflowarchive.org) (DAG in XML) 
and [JSON](http://workflowhub.org/traces/) worfklow description file formats. Refer to 
their respective Web sites for detailed documentation.

The `SimpleWMS` example implementations (either cloud or batch) are structured as follows:

- The first step is to read and parse the workflow and the SimGrid platform files, and
  create a simulation object (wrench::Simulation).
- A storage service (wrench::SimpleStorageService) is created and deployed on a host.
- A cloud (wrench::CloudService) or a batch (wrench::BatchService) service is created and 
  deployed on a host. Both services are seen by the simulation engine as a compute service 
  (wrench::ComputeService) â€“ jobs can then be scheduled to these resources. 
- A WMS (wrench::WMS) is instantiated (in this case the `SimpleWMS`) with a reference to 
  the workflow object (wrench::Workflow) and a scheduler (wrench::Scheduler). For the 
  cloud example, a cloud scheduler is required to decide when to spawn VMs on hosts. The
  batch service does not require a specific scheduler, since resources are fixed. In 
  such case, a regular scheduler can be used.
- A file registry (wrench::FileRegistryService), or a file replica catalog keeps track
  of files stored in different storage services.
- Workflow input files are staged into the storage service, and the simulation is launched. 


# Preparing the Environment #         {#getting-started-prep}

@WRENCHNotInternalDoc
## Importing WRENCH ##                {#getting-started-prep-import}

For ease of use, all WRENCH abstractions are accessed via a single 
include statement:

@WRENCHUserDoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <wrench.h>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@endWRENCHDoc

@WRENCHDeveloperDoc 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
#include <wrench-dev.h>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that `wrench-dev.h` is the only necessary include statement to be added to your 
experiment code. It includes all interfaces and services provided in `wrench.h` 
([user mode](../user/getting-started.html)), and additional interfaces to develop 
your own algorithms and services.

## Building Your CMakeLists.txt File ##                {#getting-started-prep-cmakelists}

Below is an example of a `CMakeLists.txt` file that can be used as a starting 
template for developing a WRENCH application compiled using cmake:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cmake}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.2)
message(STATUS "Cmake version ${CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION}.${CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION}.${CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION}")

project(YOUR_PROJECT_NAME)

add_definitions("-Wall -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-private-field")

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

# include directories for dependencies and WRENCH libraries
include_directories(src/ /usr/local/include /usr/local/include/wrench)

# source files
set(SOURCE_FILES
        src/main.cpp
        )

# test files
set(TEST_FILES
        )

# wrench library and dependencies
find_library(WRENCH_LIBRARY NAMES wrench)
find_library(SIMGRID_LIBRARY NAMES simgrid)
find_library(PUGIXML_LIBRARY NAMES pugixml)
find_library(LEMON_LIBRARY NAMES emon)
find_library(GTEST_LIBRARY NAMES gtest)

# generating the executable
add_executable(my-executable ${SOURCE_FILES})
target_link_libraries(my-executable 
                        ${WRENCH_LIBRARY} 
                        ${SIMGRID_LIBRARY} 
                        ${PUGIXML_LIBRARY} 
                        ${LEMON_LIBRARY}
                     )

install(TARGETS my-executable DESTINATION bin)

# generating unit tests
add_executable(unit_tests EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL 
                 ${SOURCE_FILES} 
                 ${TEST_FILES}
              )
target_link_libraries(unit_tests 
                        ${GTEST_LIBRARY} wrench -lpthread -lm
                     )

@WRENCHInternalDoc

Internal developers are expected to **contribute** code to WRENCH's core components.
Please, refer to the [API Reference](./annotated.html) to find the detailed 
documentation for WRENCH functions.

In addition to the common [installation steps](./install.html), WRENCH's internal
developers are strongly encouraged to install the following dependencies/tools:

- [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) - version 1.8 or higher (for running test cases)
- [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) - version 1.8 or higher (for generating documentation)
    

# WRENCH Directory and File Structure #         {#getting-started-structure}

WRENCH follows a standard C++ project directory and files structure:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}

+-- include                    # WRENCH header files - .h files 
+-- src                        # WRENCH source files - .cpp files
+-- test                       # WRENCH test files
+-- tools                      # Tools for supporting documentation generation and release builds
+-- .travis.yml                # Configuration file for Travis Continuous Integration
+-- sonar-project.properties   # Configuration file for Sonar Cloud Continuous Code Quality
+-- LICENSE.md                 # WRENCH license disclaimer
